# Credit_Card_Insights_Dashboard - Power Bi + SQL

Objecctive: To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

Steps:
1. The data was first analysed on excel to look out for any null or unwanted values and ensure data quality.
2. Two tables were created for consumer and transaction data in MYSQL database and the data was imported using the excel files.
3. The database was connected to PowerBi and some DAX queries were run to create measures like "Previous week revenue" and "Current week revenue" to calculate "Wow Revenue change".
4. Analysed both the transactions and consumer level data and two dashboards were created as explained below.
